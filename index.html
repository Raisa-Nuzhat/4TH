            <span id="span-one">Lorem Ipsum</span>  is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's <span id="span-two">standard dummy text </span> since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type 
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
            It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
            with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
